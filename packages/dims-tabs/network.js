//
// Nodes are measures, edges are the coherence between them, and both follow the
// playhead: the picture at 40 s is the coupling in the window around 40 s, not
// an average over the whole recording.
//
// This existed in one private study, where nobody else could use it, and it was
// the **only** consumer in the whole system of the Monte Carlo coherence null --
// the thing that costs ORTHO about 2.8 hours. So the core computed a number
// whose only reader lived somewhere the core could not see. It is an ordinary
// built-in tab now, gated by `include_network` like every other tab is gated by
// its own key, and everything study-specific about it comes from config.
//
// It needs `sig95_wtc`, and when a study has not computed one it says so rather
// than drawing. A coherence value has no meaningful zero: it is a ratio taken
// over a smoothing neighbourhood, so under independence it does not sit near 0
// but near 0.25, and exceeds ~0.59 five percent of the time. An edge reading
// 0.27 is not "weak coupling", it is *no* coupling, and nothing in the raw
// number says so.
