J_MANUAL = 7                # Manual number of octaves (used if J_AUTO = False)

# ---------- Data Processing Parameters ----------

DETREND_ORDER = 1           # Polynomial order for detrending (1 = linear)
MIN_DATA_POINTS = 50        # Minimum number of data points required
INTERPOLATION_METHOD = 'linear'  # Method for interpolating to common time base

# ---------- Significance Testing Parameters ----------
SIGNIFICANCE_LEVEL = 0.95   # Confidence level for significance testing (0.95 = 95%)
USE_AR1_NOISE = True        # Use AR1 noise model for significance (vs white noise)
MONTE_CARLO_ITERATIONS = 0  # Number of Monte Carlo iterations (0 = use theoretical)

# Significance for the *coherence* itself, which is a different question from
# sig95_xwt. sig95_xwt asks "is there more joint energy here than red noise
# would give?" -- a statement about power. Coherence asks "is the phase lag
# steadier than red noise would give?", and it needs its own null, because a
# coherence estimate does not sit at 0 under independence: it is a ratio taken
# over a smoothing neighbourhood, so a handful of random phases still average
# to something well above zero. Measured on the Karnatak data the 95% level is
# ~0.59 and two independent signals score ~0.25 on average -- so an edge value
# of 0.27 is indistinguishable from no coupling at all, which is not something
# the raw number reveals. Only a Monte Carlo against AR(1) surrogates gives it.

WCT_SIGNIF_MC_COUNT = 100   # Surrogate pairs per null (pycwt default is 300)
# The Monte Carlo is seeded, so the same input gives the same significance
# threshold every time. Unseeded, two runs over identical data disagreed by up
# to 0.04 on the 95% level (mean 0.012 across scales) -- which propagates into
# wtc_signif_fraction, i.e. the reported "% of cells significantly coupled"
# was not reproducible. Set to None to restore the old random behaviour.
#
# On mc_count: 100 is a compromise against a cold-run cost of ~45 s. The
# disk cache below means that cost is paid once per (alpha, grid) rather than
# per pair, per video and per re-run, so raising this toward pycwt's default
# of 300 is affordable if a tighter null is wanted for publication.

# realistic red-noise coefficient collides into one "wct_sig_nan_nan_..." file

    power-significance mask.

    Two pycwt quirks are handled here:

    * Its on-disk cache is unusable. The cache filename is built from
      ``arctanh(alpha * 4)``, which is NaN for any alpha > 0.25 -- so every
      realistic red-noise coefficient collides into a single
      ``wct_sig_nan_nan_...`` file and you silently get back a null computed for
      different coefficients. We always pass cache=False and memoise ourselves.
    * For the largest scales, which lie entirely inside the cone of influence,
      it returns 0 rather than NaN. Zero would mean "every cell is significant",
      the exact opposite of the truth, so those rows are turned into NaN and the
      consumer skips them.

    ``n_scales`` is ``len(scales)`` as returned by ``wavelet.cwt``, NOT the J
    passed to it. With the default J_AUTO, J is a float (e.g. 95.55): cwt
    rounds it up to 97 scales while ``wct_significance(int(J))`` returns 96, and
    the length guard at the call site would then discard the field on every
    single run. Deriving J from the scale count keeps the two aligned.

    Cost is independent of the recording length: pycwt sizes its own surrogates
    from the scale range, so a 2-minute and a 20-minute video pay the same.
